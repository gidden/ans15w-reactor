\section{Introduction}

Engineering learning and teaching styles are known to be somewhat contradictory
\cite{felder2000learning}. While many students tend to prefer active and visual
learning, most education is in the form of abstract and sequential
concepts. This is no different in nuclear engineering, where complicated
concepts such as energy and direction-dependent neutron transport are
transmitted. Computer games provide a fun and natural way to reinforce learning
and gain valuable intuition for physical phenomena. In this vein, an open-source,
neutron-physics simulation game was created that allows users to explore
interactions of neutrons with different materials and geometric
configurations. Basic concepts such as scattering, absorption, fission are
exposed to students in an interactive, composable environment. Used in
conjunction with traditional teaching methods, such a tool may prove valueable
in an effort to instill basic physical intuition and accelerate the learning of
such complicated subject matter.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Methodology}

On each time step of the simulation, neutron positions are updated as a
function of their velocities.  Then, if the neutron is inside any material,
possible reactions (e.g. fission, scattering, etc.) occur according to
probabilities defined by that material.  These probabilities are calculated as
a function of distance each neutron traveled on the current time step.
Interaction probabilities and value sampling are not necessarily done using
"correct" nuclear data or equations.  Rather, fundamental concepts are
approximately modeled and specific values for probabilities were adjusted to
make the playing simulation informative and fun.  Physics concepts modeled
include:

\begin{itemize}

    \item Absorption: The probability of absorption is a function of neutron
        energy/speed.  Absorber material can also be burned up over time.

    \item Scattering: All scattering is isotropic.

    \item Fission: The probability of fission is a function of neutron
        energy/speed.  Fuel material can also be burned up over time, loosing
        reactivity.  The number of neutrons released from a fission event is
        randomly sampled from a normal distribution to be some integer near 2.

    \item Moderation: Neutrons can loose some portion of their energy when
        scattering in certain materials. Some materials moderate more or less
        effectively as a function of their "temperature" (number of neutrons
        inside them) - this enables crude modeling of concepts like reactor
        void coefficients.

\end{itemize}

In addition to the neutron population, the positions of materials and other
blocks are tracked and drawn to the screen in real-time.  The user can drag
around material blocks with the mouse.  Partially transparent detector blocks
can also be moved around by the user to investigate neutron populations of
specific parts of the simulation environment.  The user can also introduce
isotropic bursts of neutrons at any location they right-click in the
environment (including inside material blocks).  If materials are moved on top
of each other, the one on top "wins" and becomes the sole determiner of
physics for that region of the simulation.

There are many improvements and features waiting to be added.  One limitation
involves how time steps are calculated.  Because the simulation operates with
a variable frame rate, the time change and position change for neutrons
between time steps increases as the system becomes more computationally
expensive to model (i.e. too many neutrons on the screen).  This slowdown
results in neutrons traveling too far between events and reaction
probabilities being scaled inappropriately high.  This could be prevented by
adjusting a neutron weight parameter instead of increasing the neutron
population when the time change between time steps grows too large.  This
would simulataneously allow the user to see how power continues to grow over
much longer periods of time in supercritical configurations.

\section{Experiments and Results}

Below, three simple experiments are presented that show how this simulation
game can be used to explore nuclear engineering principles.  Because this
simulation game is open source, you can download and run these (and other)
experiments yourself.  The code is available on Github at
\url{https://github.com/rwcarlsen/reactor}.  Materials and other objects used
in the simulation experiments below are represented by different colored
squares.  The meaning of each square is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
        
    \item White (large): neutron energy independent scattering medium.

    \item Green (medium): neutron energy independent moderating/scattering.
        medium.

    \item Blue (medium): neutron energy dependent burnable absorber.

    \item Purple (small): fissile material or fuel.

    \item Olive (small): togglable constant streaming neutron source.

    \item Yellow (transparent): neutron detector that reports the number of
        neutrons inside it without affecting neutrons or material properties
        underneath itself.

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Attenuation}

      detector, absorbing material, and an additional detector.}

    \caption{Upon depeletion of the absorber, no attenuation of neutrons is observed.}
    \label{fig:atten-done}

    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{atten-off.png}
    \caption{After turning off the neutron beam, absorber depletion is observable.}
    \label{fig:atten-off}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Super-criticality and Burnup}

The configuration shown in Figure \ref{fig:thermal-setup} contains a fuel
block surounded by a region of moderator all enclosed by a scattering block
that acts as a reflector.  After a single burst of 1,000 neutrons is released
into the center of the fuel, the neutron population quickly grows.  With a
detector placed over the top of the super-critical system, the neutron
population growth can be quantified. After just over 2 minutes, the population
passes 15,000 neutrons as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:thermal-on}.  This
growth would continue indefinitely if it weren't for the depletion of the
fuel.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{reactor-thermal-setup.png}
    \caption{Supercritical thermal reactor setup.}
    \label{fig:thermal-setup}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{reactor-thermal-1min.png}
    \caption{Supercritical thermal reactor continues to grow its neutron population. }
    \label{fig:thermal-on}
\end{figure}

After a few minutes of operation in the super-critical state, the reactor was
shut down by removing the fuel from the system until the neutrons died away.
This reactor configuration results in non-uniform burnup of the fuel. This is
apparent in the post shutdown state shown in Figure \ref{fig:thermal-after};
the fuel's purple color transitions to grey as fissile atoms are burned up.
The fuel nearer to the moderator has higher burnup due to the short mean free
path of thermalized neutrons coming from the moderator.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{reactor-thermal-after.png}
    \caption{After shutdown, the thermal reactor exhibits non-uniform burnup in the fuel. }
    \label{fig:thermal-after}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Subcritical Multiplication}

Subcritical multiplication is an interesting phenomenon that can be
illustrated well in the game.  To show this, we break the experiment into two
setups: a neutron source streaming into a non-fuel environment, and a neutron
source streaming into an environment with fuel.  Figure
\ref{fig:scatter-setup} shows the unfueled environment with the neutron
streaming source on the right and a large scattering block on the left.  A
detector is placed over the scattering medium and the streaming source is
turned on. Figure \ref{fig:scatter-equil} shows this setup after the detector
has reached an approximate equilibrium state with about 2,500 neutrons.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{scatter-setup.png}
    \caption{Reference setup for measuring neutron equilibrium in a scattering medium.}
    \label{fig:scatter-setup}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{scatter-equil.png}
    \caption{Reference scattering setup reaches an equilibrium neutron population of about 2500 neutrons when fed by a constant streaming source.}
    \label{fig:scatter-equil}
\end{figure}

The setup and procedure show by Figures \ref{fig:scatter-setup} and
\ref{fig:scatter-equil} is repeated with a fuel block placed in the center of
the scattering medium - shown in Figure \ref{fig:subcrit-setup}.  After
turning on the neutron source, this setup reaches an approximate equilibrium
state with about 10,000 neutrons - nearly four times more than the same setup
without the fuel material block.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{subcrit-mult-setup.png}
    \caption{Fuel was introduced into the scattering medium creating a subcritical multiplication configuration.}
    \label{fig:subcrit-setup}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{subcrit-mult-equil.png}
    \caption{Subcritical multiplication reaches an equilibrium neutron population of about 10,000 neutrons when fed by a constant neutron source.}
    \label{fig:subcrit-equil}
\end{figure}

For those who like equations in their papers, \LaTeX\ is a good choice. Here is
an equation for the Marshak diffusion boundary condition:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:marshak}
  4 J^- = \phi + 2 D \vec{n} \vd \grad \phi \,.
\end{equation}
If we so choose, we can effortlessly reference the equation later.

Another paragraph starts with Eq.~\eqref{eq:marshak} and sets $J^-$ to zero, a
vacuum boundary condition:
\begin{equation*}
  0 = \phi + \frac{2}{3} \frac{1}{\sigma} \vec{n} \vd \grad \phi \,.
\end{equation*}

The extrapolation distance is $2/3$. A more detailed asymptotic analysis yields
an extrapolation distance of about $0.71045$.
